!Putting on Git because this was a PITA compared to the encryption process.

!Below script decrypts all *.enc in a directory and adds .txt to extension

cd /path/to/folder

foo=".txt"

for file in *.enc;

  do
      echo $file
      bar=$file$foo
      echo $bar
      openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -in $file -out $bar -pass file:/path/to/key.pub
  done
